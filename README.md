**Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch**

This repository contains implementations of popular Machine Learning algorithms built from scratch using only Python and fundamental libraries (such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib). The goal is to understand the mathematical foundations and working principles behind each algorithm without relying on pre-built ML frameworks (like scikit-learn or TensorFlow).

**Implemented Algorithms**

_Supervised Learning_

   Linear Regression
   Logistic Regression
   Na√Øve Bayes
   k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   Support Vector Machines (SVM)
   Decision Trees
 

_Unsupervised Learning_

  k-Means Clustering
  Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

_Neural Networks_

  Simple Feedforward Neural Network (with backpropagation)
